Subject: Request for One Time Settlement (OTS) on Loan Account

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing regarding my outstanding {loan_type.lower()} with {lender}, currently overdue by {overdue_days} days, with an outstanding balance of Rs. {amount:,.0f}.

Due to a temporary but significant financial constraint, I have been unable to maintain regular EMI payments of Rs. {emi:,.0f}. After careful assessment of my financial situation, I would like to propose a One Time Settlement of Rs. {settlement_amount:,.0f} (approximately {settlement_pct:.0f}% of the outstanding amount), payable in full within 15 working days of your written approval.

I believe this settlement would be mutually beneficial — it allows you to recover a substantial portion of the outstanding balance while helping me avoid further financial distress. I am committed to honouring this agreement promptly upon your approval.

I sincerely request you to consider this proposal favourably. Upon settlement, I kindly request that you report my account status to the credit bureau as "Settled."

I am available for any discussion or documentation required and can be reached at {user_email}.

Yours sincerely,
{user_name}
{user_email}"""
